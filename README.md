# Top Flight Security
This website lets you sign up for an account at your job. And Clock in when you get into work with the date, time and location. Then on a seperate page you could add time-off request and call outs.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

My learning was focused on creating a full stack app. I made a log in and sign up to store user data in a database, then allowed people to clock in on a time sheet to say when they clocked in for work. A clock in time sheet was perfect for me to practice using CRUD and take and store inforamtion into a database.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that user data could be manipulated in the database platform you choose to use. It is imperitive to keep your database private for security and privacy of your users.

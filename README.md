## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

My learning was focused on creating a full stack app. I made a log in and sign up to store user data in a database, then allowed people to clock in on a time sheet to say when they clocked in for work. A clock in time sheet was perfect for me to practice using CRUD and take and store inforamtion into a database.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that user data could be manipulated in the database platform you choose to use. It is imperitive to keep your database private for security and privacy of your users.
